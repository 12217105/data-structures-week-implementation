# Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of common data structures:

## Implemented Structures

### 1. Dynamic Array
- A resizable array that doubles its capacity when full.
- Supports adding, setting, getting, and printing elements.
- **Overall Time Complexity:**
 
  - Total complexity in a typical program run: O(n)

### 2. Singly Linked List
- A linked list where each node points to the next node.
- Supports appending elements, deleting the front, and printing the list
  - Total complexity in a typical program run: O(n)

### 3. Stack (Array-based)
- A stack implemented using an array.
- Supports:
  - `push(value)`: Add element to the top.
  - `pop()`: Remove the top element.
  - `top()`: View the top element.
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
  - `print()`: Print all elements.
  - Total complexity: O(n)

### 4. Stack (Linked List-based)
- A stack implemented using a linked list.
- Supports:
  - `push(value)`: Add element to the top.
  - `pop()`: Remove the top element.
  - `top()`: View the top element.
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
  - `print()`: Print all elements.
